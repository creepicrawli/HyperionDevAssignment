Space Complexity Analysis
The sayNumber() function has a space complexity of O(n), 
where n is the number of digits in the input integer. 
This is because the function creates an array of length n to store the digits of the input integer, 
and then creates several arrays of fixed length to store the units, tens, and thousands.

Additionally, the function creates an array to store the output string, 
which can potentially have a length of up to 64 times the length of the input integer (for the number 999,999,999,999,999). 
However, this worst-case scenario is unlikely to occur, as it requires all digits of the input integer to be non-zero.

Overall, the space complexity of the sayNumber() function is dominated by the space required to store the input integer as an array, 
which is proportional to the number of digits in the input integer.
