# In the sorted() function call on line 5, the parameter i needs to be passed to it so that it sorts the characters
# of the current string being processed.

# The result dictionary is being created with a default value of an empty list, which can be simplified
# by using the defaultdict class from the collections module.

# The Solution class and its instance ob1 are not necessary, as the function can be defined
# as a standalone function.
